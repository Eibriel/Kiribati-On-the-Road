<p>A delivery man is lost on this alien planet and the only way to return home is to escape using his hover bike. 
Collect gasoline cans and power the engines on this long trip to the rescue zone.
The levels are randomly generated so each play is different!

<h3>Godot Source Project</h3>
This public repository contains the entire source project for the game.
You can open this project with [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org) version 2.0 alpha (03/10/2015) or greater.
Note: The game was made using a nightly compiled version for Godot (http://www.godotengine.org/documents/118) so some compatibility issues may arise.
